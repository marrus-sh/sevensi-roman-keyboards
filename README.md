  [Ukelele](https://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) for input of Romanized
  Sevensi text.
For more information on the design of the Sevensi Romanization, see

##  Installation  ##

1.  Clone this repository, or download it as a ZIP and unzip its
      contents.

2.  In Finder, click `Go > Go to Folder…` and type `~/Library`, then
      press Return to navigate to your user library folder.

3.  Create the `Keyboard Layouts` directory if it doesn't already
      exist in this folder.

4.  Drag `SevensiRoman.bundle` (from this repository) into the
      `Keyboard Layouts` folder.

##  Usage  ##

Open System Preferences, click on Keyboard, and then Input Sources.
Use the + button to add a new input source.
The "native" Sevensi Roman keyboard will be available under the `art`
  category (for artificial languages).
The Bilingual Sevensi Roman keyboard will be available under the
  English category.

##  Notes  ##

+   The native keyboard does not use dead keys (instead outputting
      combining characters directly); typing is done in handwriting
      order.

+   The bilingual keyboard is the same as a typical US keyboard layout
      when the Option key is not held down.
    It has a large number of dead keys, most of which are located in
      the top row.

##  Changelog  ##

+   **1.0 :**
    Initial release.
